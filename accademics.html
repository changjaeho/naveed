				<h1>Math Is One of My Favorite Subjects!!</h1>
				<p>
					I love math since it's a subject that can calculate so many things. I find solving the questions they give at school fun to do sometime(I also get bored of doing
					too many math questions). It was my favorite subject in all of elementry and most of middle chool(even though I had one of those kindergarden to grade 8 schools).
					After math Would come science when it comes to my interests in accademics.

				<h1>SCIENCE Is One of My Favorite Subjects!!</h1>
				<p>
					I love SCIENCE for the same reason as math since there are so many more interesting things you can learn about the world that sound really weird. Although sometimes
					the things in SCIENCE seem unexplainable or straight up wrong but that's the fun in learning. Although I'll be the first to admit there aren't many exciding things
					inside middle school science which is why I hope that highschool will be better(maybe).
