	<h2>2. Games</h2>
	<p>
		I was a person who used to often play games all the time and even stayed up at night to play them but ironicaly I haven't been playing them as much even though we are in the middle of a pandemic. I do still play games just not as much but etheir way I think that I really enjoy games

	<h2>3. Badminton</h2>
	<p>
		My dad introduced me into the sport and ever since I had loved it. It was fun to play this sport since it was all about controlling the birde and how fast you could make it go. It was a good way to pas the time when me and my family rented out a cottage.
