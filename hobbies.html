				Ever since I was six or seven I had an interest in chess. At first it started just because I thought the horse piece was cool but it has turned into something
				love(I still think the horse is cool). On the left there is a game of chess that you can play against a computer and I suggest that you take the time to play
				a match since I find it very enjoyable and hope that you do too. Having the only goal to capture the king makes chess a game I play when I'm stressed since the focus
				Capturing the king helps me temporarily forget the day's worries.
